citizens they couldn’t safely or 
reliably relocate and separate the 
infected from the healthy.  To 
prevent further spread of the 
disease they built a wall, no one 
in and no one out.  Yesterday they 
cut the power to this part of the 
city.  It has been weeks and I 
think they have decided to let us 
die in here, some-how I need to get
over that wall, ideally without 
getting infected… or shot.
