In this game your goal is simple...
               SURVIVE             
  Unfortunatly nothing in life is 
that simple.  The city is dieing 
most of the surviving population
has been infected and many of those
that havent been infected have lost
there minds.  
  Looting, civil warfare, and 
violence has run rampant.  If 
mattters were not bad enough the 
city itself is running out of food
and fuel.  You Cant stay here, if 
you do you will either be killed 
violently or starve... both are 
rather grim outcomes.  
             But fear not 
Your not going to have to do this 
alone.  You have your friendly 
neighborhood apocalypse guide to 
show you the ropes so you can find 
your way to thrive in this 
unforgiving landscape.
